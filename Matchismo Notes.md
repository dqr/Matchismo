PlayingCardDeck : Lecture 2 Slide 32  
Card            : Lecture 2 Slide 162  

XCode walkthrough starts at Lecture 2 Slide 35.

### 2012Feb3

Launched XCode from the command line (having looked at the unit test video

In GUI, followed stuff on slides 35-44, except answered yes to both unit tests and to source control.

Adding the model starts on slide 148, started with that.

Added the Card model and committed.

Added the rest of the models, committing after each one.

Now to the beginning part, the UI...


### 2012Feb8

Looking at the commit log and the state of the product, it looks like we left off with a working Homework 0, which is the last thing in the Lecture 2 Slides.

Added this file (these notes) to the repository

On to Lecture 3â€¦  Looks like we'll start at slide 5 and just work linearly through the slides doing the stuff.  Once that's done, we'll be on to Assignment 1 as alluded to on slide 129.

Slides 5 - 33 just deal with going from 1 button to 12 of them.

Slides 34 - 43 deal with what was done in HW 0, i.e. making a random deck, not just the ace of clubs.  On slide 34 Paul uses a single line if (no braces).  I think I'll keep the braces, but shrink it to one line too.  Throw a commit in here for good measure.

Assignment 1.

Task 1 - just do the walkthrough that's in the lecture 3 slides.  Done.

Task 2 - add 4 more cards.  Copy/Paste last row.  Trick is to be sure to add the copied buttons to the outlet collection.

Task 3 - add a label for the match results.  Added the label in the storyboard, add a new flipResultsProperty to the model, and modify the controller to update the view (storyboard) based on the results from the model (CarMatchingGame).

Task 4 - Add a deal button.  Added a Deal button and wired up to the controller as an Action (drag to inside implementation).  Code for dealNewDeck nils the game so we alloc init a new one on next reference.  Then clean up flip count and flipResults labels (score is automatic via new game), and update the UI.

Task 5 - Add a 3 card mode and make it switchable between 2 card and 3 card mode.

Added a UISegmentedControl to view.  Connected the valueChanged action and stubbed it out with an NSLog.
Next step is to flesh this out with the model changes to support different number of matches, and to kick the model as the action to value changed.

For the points calculation:

<pre>
From the CardMatchingGame model file:

#define flipCost 1
#define MATCH_BONUS 4
#define MISMATCH_PENALTY 2

From the PlayingCard model file:

if ([otherCard.suit isEqualToString:self.suit])
{
    score = 1;
}
else if (otherCard.rank == self.rank)
{
    score = 4;

</pre>

That yields 4 and 16 raw score for a suit and rank match.  The 4:1 holds for any given card there are 12 others same suit and 3 others same rank.  If we choose 2 cards, then this becomes not 12:3, but 11:2 so maybe we make it 5.5:1  Of course that doesn't address the overall odds which seem harder in the case of a 3 card match.

This seems again like we plop a control in the UI, add an action to the controller, and modify the model to support the 3 card logic.  Need to figure out the correct points for 3 card matches (suits and ranks), and it seems like we need to modify the logic so that we only check for matches in one mode or the the other.  That is in current 2 card mode we look for another playable face up card.  In 3 card mode we'll need to look for two of them.

## Random Notes

Some magic to change the brace style default in XCode:
